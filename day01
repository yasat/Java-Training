Answer the below question :

1. Can you create a sub class to the following class?
class A
{
    private A()
    {
        //First Constructor
    }
     
    private A(int i)
    {
        //Second Constructor
    }
}

2. Does field ‘i’ of Class A be inherited to Class B in the below code?

class A
{
    protected int i;
}
 
class B extends A
{
     
}

3. Is the below code written correctly?

class A
{
    private class B
    {
        //inner class
    }
}
 
public class MainClass extends A
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        B b = new B();
    }
}

4. Is the below code written correctly?

package pack1;
 
class A
{
     
}
 
package pack2;
 
class B extends A
{
     
}

5. Can we declare a class as protected?
6. Do you think the below program is written correctly? If yes, what will be the output?

package pack1;
 
class X
{
    protected int i = 1221;
     
    void methodOfX()
    {
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
 
public class MainClass
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        X x = new X();
         
        System.out.println(x.i);
         
        x.methodOfX();
    }
}

7. Is the below programme works ? If not what will be the reason ?

package pack1;
 
class A
{
    public A()
    {
        //public constructor
    }
}
 
package pack2;
 
import pack1.*;
 
class B
{
    A a = new A();       //Compile Time Error
}

8. Can a protected field of a class be inherited to subclass outside the package?
9.Why Line 17 in the below code is throwing compile time error?

package pack1;
 
public class A
{
    protected A()
    {
        //protected constructor
    }
}
 
package pack2;
 
import pack1.A;
 
class B
{
    A a = new A();
}

10. Can we declare static methods as private?

11. What will be the outcome of the below program?

package pack1;
 
public class A
{
    private int methodOne(int i)
    {
        return ++i;
    }
     
    public int methodTwo(int i)
    {
        return methodOne(++i);
    }
}
 
package pack2;
 
import pack1.A;
 
class B extends A
{
    int methodOne(int i)
    {
        return methodTwo(++i);
    }
}
 
public class MainClass
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println(new B().methodOne(101));
    }
}

12. Can you find out the error in the following code snippet?

class A
{
    public void methodOfA()
    {
        System.out.println("Class A");
    }
}
 
class B extends A
{
    @Override
    void methodOfA()
    {
        System.out.println("Class B");
    }
}

13. private method can be overridden as public method. True or False?

14. A method of super class with default access modifier can be overridden as protected or public but not as private. True or false?

15. Write the code on below scenario :

Create an Employee Object which has the below members :

1. name : public member.
2. address : public member.
3. salary : private member
4. id : public member

you need to create three employee such as : CEO,Project Manager and Team Lead who will inherit all those properties.
You need to create one more super user HR who has access over the system and can see all the details of all employees. This class will contain one method calculatesalary which will give 
the salary of the employee as : employee's salary * hike (consider hike =10%).

Data Sample :

CEO : name : "Rajesh Kumar ", address : "SaltLake,Kolkata", salary : 70000, id :1, calculatedsalary : 70000*10%
